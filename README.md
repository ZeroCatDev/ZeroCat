## Background

`ZeroCat` was originally proposed by [@sunwuyuan](https://github.com/sunwuyuan) a long time ago. Our goal is to create a fully open-source programming community, and this project started from that vision. However, significant progress was made only when Sun Wuyuan was in the second year of middle school.

Maintaining a programming community is, to some extent, quite challenging, but I believe this project will continue to develop.

The goal of this repository is to:
<br/>Develop a comprehensive programming community that supports Scratch, Python, and other languages suitable for beginner programmers.
